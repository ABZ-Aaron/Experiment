# Psychology Experiment

This is psychology experiment (Stroop) created as part of my master's degree.

### Prerequisites

* Python Installed - [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* PsychoPy Installed - [link](https://www.psychopy.org)

### Overview

A Stroop Task is a psychology experiment used to measure one's selective attention and/or processing speed.

This repository contains the materials to run such a task. You'll find 3 files:

* [stroop](stroop.py) - This is the main experiment file, which should be run through Psychopy
* [analyse_stroop](analyse_stroop.py) - This is the analysis file. One the stroop task has been run for all participants, running this will provide some useful statistics.
* [labwiki](labwiki.pdf) - This provides detailed instructions on running the experiment and analysis.

For a full set of instructions, please view this [guide](labwiki.pdf).

### What I learned from this project

This was one of the first Python projects I worked on with minimal tutorials or assistance. It was here that I learned how to program, and began to develop some proficiency with Python. 

As this was one of the first projects I worked on, the biggest barrier was getting to grips with basic python syntax and programming concepts, as well as those specific to PsychoPy. This required a few late nights in order for me to fully grasp these. Once I felt more confident with the basics, I was then able to complete the project. 

I think what I enjoyed most about this type of project was going beyond the set specifications, be a bit creative, and add in new features (e.g. trial runs, parameter options). It was during these moments where I really began developing proficiency in Python (and in Googling things!). It was also exciting creating something which felt useful, and that could be released to a real psychology lab.
