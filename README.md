# Psychology Experiment

This is psychology experiment (Stroop) created as part of my master's degree.

### Prerequisites

* Python Installed
* PsychoPy Installed

### Overview

A Stroop Task is a psychology experiment used to measure one's selective attention and/or processing speed.

This repository contains the materials to run such a task. You'll find 3 files:

* stroop - This is the main experiment file, which should be run through Psychopy
* analyse_stroop - This is the analysis file. One the stroop task has been run for all participants, running this will provide some useful statistics.
* labwiki - This provides detailed instructions on running the experiment and analysis.
